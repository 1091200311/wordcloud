Word cloud, also known as text cloud, is a visual representation of text data. It is composed of words, which is used to display a large number of text data. It is usually used to describe keyword metadata (labels) on a website, or to visualize free-form text. The importance of each word is displayed in font size or color. Each word in the word cloud represents one or more values in the dimension. The size of the word indicates how often a value appears in the selected dimension, proportional to the frequency of other values in the same dimension. Word cloud is the best when accuracy is unimportant and there are no large numbers of different values. The essence of word cloud is point graph, which is the result of drawing text with specific style at corresponding coordinate points. The role of word cloud: quickly perceive the most prominent words, and quickly locate the relatively prominent parts of the words arranged in alphabetical order.
Word cloud was first used by Richie Gordon, an associate professor of Journalism and director of new media at Northwestern University in 2006. Gordon has been an editor and journalist and has served as director of the new media edition of the Miami Herald. He has been concerned about the latest forms of content distribution on the Internet - the only way that the Internet can use and that newspapers, radio, television and other media are beyond reach.
